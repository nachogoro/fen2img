         * Converts a FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) string representation of a chessboard
         * to a 2D character array matrix representation.
         *
         * The matrix is organized as follows:
         * - The rows of the matrix (first dimension) correspond to ranks on the chessboard, with `board[0]`
         * representing rank 8 and `board[7]` representing rank 1.
         * - The columns of the matrix (second dimension) correspond to files on the chessboard, with `board[x][0]`
         * representing file 'a' and `board[x][7]` representing file 'h'.
         *
         * Thus, to get the piece at a specific rank and file from the matrix, you can use:
         * `board[8 - rank][file - 'a']`
         *
         * And conversely, given a matrix coordinate `(i, j)`, the corresponding rank and file would be:
         * `rank = 8 - i`
         * `file = 'a' + j`
         *
         * Each square of the matrix is represented by a character:
         * - Uppercase characters represent white pieces.
         * - Lowercase characters represent black pieces.
         * - '-' represents an empty square.
         *
         * @param fen The FEN string representation of the chessboard. It should be properly formatted.
         * @return A 8x8 matrix where each cell represents a square on the chessboard.
         *
         * Example:
         * ```
         * val fen = "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR"
         * val board = fenToMatrix(fen)
         * println(board[0][0])  // prints 'r' (Black rook at rank 8 and file 'a')
         * ```
